Great Question. Many tourists and travellers struggle when it comes to planning their trips to famous cities like London. Instead of being that person, you have come here! Great! Let's find the right plan for you:
<br>
<br>
1 - Starting with time management, many tourists find it is hard to manage what places to visit in the time frame they have set for their vacation. Because there are so many attractions in London, let's get you familiar with the best ones to prioritize visiting. Check out our attractions page for more information.
<br>
<br>
2 - Now that you are familiar with some attractions in London, pick out 2-3 you really want to visit. Got them? Great, now I want you to view our table with information on visiting attractions.
</h6>

<div class="h7">
<button class="accordion">Attractions vs. Time Table</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p><table>
    <tr>
      <th></th>
      <th>Amout of Days</th>
      <th>Amout of Attractions</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td rowspan="4">Recommended</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      
      <td>2-6</td>
      <td>1-3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      
      <td>7</td>
      <td>3-4</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      
      <td>8-14...</td>
      <td>5-10...</td>
    </tr>
  </table></p>
</div>

3 - Now that you have an idea of how many places you can visit in your vacation time, try to fit the attractions you picked earlier into your schedule. If you picked out four favorites and only have time for three, no need to worry! Next time you come, the attraction you picked but didn't go to will be waiting for your visit.
<br>
<br>
<blockquote> - having trouble building your schedule? Try thinking of it this way: Each day you need time to wake up, get ready, and eat. Then, if you aren't renting a car, you need time to catch a ride. Then, you need to give yourself a reasonable amount of time to visit and marvel over the attraction you picked for the day. If you get tired easily, one attraction might be good for one day. Not to mention you may want to try new foods and restaurants along the way. (That can take time!) Have a better idea now? </blockquote>
<br>
<br>
4 - The schedule should be built I assume? Great! Success by you! We won't be guiding you through the streets of London, so here are some safety tips:
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Keep your belongings on you and be careful who you hang around</li>
  <li>Get a trusted hotel, Airbnb, Vrbo, etc</li>
  <li>If you can, travel with a friend. If not, make sure to share your plans with a trusted person and have emergency contacts</li>
  <li>Careful with food or drinks in places you don't know</li>
  <li>Heavily research where you are going. This website helps with planning your attraction visits, not as much the booking and researching </li>
</ul>

<br>
<br>
6 - Don't stress! You have your schedule filled with all your plans for this vacation. The least you can do is have fun! You won't need us for anymore help, so farewell!
